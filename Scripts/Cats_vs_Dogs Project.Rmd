# Introduction to the Data Set

- The data was received from the Tidy Tuesday Repository

--

- The data frame includes cat and dog population and ownership data from the United States.

--

- It was uploaded to the Tidy Tuesday Repository in 2018, but was originally uploaded on data.world in 2016.

--

- The data was collected from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).

# Cat Owner Percentage in the U.S.

- This plot illustrates the percentage of cat owners in the United States.

- This plot only contains data for the continental states due to lacking data for Alaska and Hawaii.

# Dog vs. Cat Households by State

- This next plot is a diverging bar plot that compares the number of dog and cat households per state.

--

- I mutated the data frame to subtract the number of dog households from the number of cat households.

--

- The diverging plot shows whether the state has more dog or cat households.

--

  - Dog households are colored red while cat households are colored blue.

```{r}
CatvDog_Data_Bar <- CatvDog_Data %>%
  mutate(value = n_dog_households - n_cat_households)  # Subtracts the number of dog households from the number of cat households for all of the states. Places them ina new column named 'Value'

color <- ifelse(CatvDog_Data_Bar$value < 0, "red", "blue")  # Assigns the volor blue to values less than zero and assigns red to those above 0.
```

# Dog vs. Cat Households by State

- From the plot, it appears that more states have more households with dogs compared to cats.

--

  - Except for a few states: 

--

  - Massachusetts
    
--

  - Washington
  
--

  - and some other states

# More State Comparisons for Dogs vs. Cats

- I decided to compare the three most populous states (California, Texas, and Florida) to the three least populous states (Wyoming, Vermont, and North Dakota).

--

- I compared the populations, number of households, and the average number within the households of both cats and dogs.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
CatvDog_Stats <- CatvDog_Data %>%
  filter(state %in% c("California", "Texas", "Florida", "Wyoming", "Vermont", "North Dakota")) %>% # Filters the data by the states chosen. 
  select(state, n_cat_households, n_dog_households, cat_population, dog_population, avg_cats_per_household, avg_dogs_per_household) # Allows me to select the specific columns that I want to show in the data.
```

---
# More State Comparisons for Dogs vs. Cats

```{r}
knitr::kable(CatvDog_Stats, format = 'html',
             col.names = c("State", "Number of Cat Households", "Number of Dog Households", "Cat Population", "Dog Population", "Average Cats per Household", "Average Dogs per Household")) %>% # Gives nicer column names to the table.
  kable_styling(position = "left", full_width = FALSE) %>%  # Positions the table to the left and makes it so it is not full width.
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE, color = "black", background = "lightgrey") %>% # Bolds the column titles and makes them black. Makes the background of the column a light grey.
  row_spec(0, background  = "turquoise") #%>% # Colors the first row of the table with all of the titles turquoise
  #save_kable(file = "CatvDogTable.jpg")  # Saves the table as a .jpg file using webshot.
```

---
# More States Comparisons for Cats vs. Dogs

- As expected, states with larger populations have larger cat and dog populations as well as number of households.

--

- However, the average amount of cats and dogs per household is fairly consistent in each state despite the difference in population size within the states.
