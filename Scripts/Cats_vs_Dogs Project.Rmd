# Introduction to the Data Set

- The data was received from the Tidy Tuesday Repository

--

- The data frame includes cat and dog owner data from the United States

```{r}
CatvDog_Data <- read.csv(here("Independent Project", "Data", "cats_vs_dogs.csv"))

# Cat Owner Percentage in the U.S.

- This plot illustrates the percentage of cat owners in the United States.

--

- This plot only contains data for the continental states due to lacking data for Alaska and Hawaii.

# Dog Owner Percentage in the U.S.

- This plot illustrates the percentage of dog owners in the United States.

- Like the plot before, this plot only contains data for the continental states due to lacking data for Alaska and Hawaii.

# Dog vs. Cat Households by State

- This next plot is a diverging bar plot that compares the number of dog and cat households per state.

--

- I mutated the data frame to subtract the number of dog households from the number of cat households.

--

- The diverging plot shows whether the state has more dog or cat households.

--

  - Dog households are colored red while cat households are colored blue.

```{r}
CatvDog_Data_Bar <- CatvDog_Data %>%
  mutate(value = n_dog_households - n_cat_households)

color <- ifelse(CatvDog_Data_Bar$value < 0, "red", "blue")
```

# Dog vs. Cat Households by State

- From the plot, it appears that more states have more households with dogs compared to cats.

--

  - Except for a few states: 

--

  - Massachusetts
    
--

  - Washington
  
--

  - and some other states

# Statistics for Dogs vs. Cats

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

colnames(CatvDog_Data_Stats) <- c("filename","mean_cat_population", "mean_dog_population", "avg_dogs_per_household", "avg_cats_per_household") # Gives column names to the data frame

}


```
- I averaged the populations of both dogs and cats for all 48 states.

--

- I also averaged out the average number of dogs and cats per household for every state.

--

```{r}
knitr::kable(CatvDog_Data_Stats, format = 'html',
             col.names = c("File Name", "Mean Cat Population", "Mean Dog Population", "Average Cats per Household", "Average Dogs per Household")) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "left", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE, color = "black", background = "lightgrey") %>%
  row_spec(0, background  = "turquoise")
```

--

- Cats have a larger overall population despite having less households.

--

- People seem to own around 1-2 cats and 2 dogs per household.

# Cat vs. Dogs

- Which do you prefer?

  - Cats?
  
  
  - Dogs?
  
  
  - Both?
  
  
  - Neither?
